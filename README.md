# Welcome to Bartogh's World

This is a playground for myself, to keep the files and stuff i find, use or
create in my quest to learn myself to use Linux OS (Arch), bash (zsh), tmux,
vim (neovim),  scripting in those programs, and eventually learn to code in
Lua, Python, Rust and Go, but that are way out in the future....
